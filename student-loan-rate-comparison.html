The information obtained on this site is based on what our lenders have provided to Purefy.

If you work in the private sector, are in the military or taking advantage of a federal department of relief program, such as income based repayment or public service forgiveness, you may not want to refinance, as these benefits do not transfer to private refinance/consolidation loans. </p><p>Purefy reserves the right to modify or discontinue products and benefits at any time without notice. </p><hr><p> <strong>Citizens Disclaimers:</strong> </p><p><strong>Citizens Co-signer Release: </strong>Borrowers may apply for co-signer release after making 36 consecutive on-time payments of principal and interest. For the purpose of the application for co-signer release, on-time payments are defined as payments received within 15 days of the due date. Interest only payments do not qualify. The borrower must meet certain credit and eligibility guidelines when applying for the co-signer release. Borrowers must complete an application for release and provide income verification documents as part of the review. Borrowers who use deferment or forbearance will need to make 36 consecutive on-time payments after reentering repayment to qualify for release. The borrower applying for co-signer release must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. If an application for co-signer release is denied, the borrower may not reapply for co-signer release until at least one year from the date the application for co-signer release was received. Terms and conditions apply.</p><p><strong>Federal Loan vs. Private Loan Benefits: </strong>Some federal student loans include unique benefits that the borrower may not receive with a private student loan, some of which we do not offer with the Education Refinance Loan. Borrowers should carefully review their current benefits, especially if they work in public service, are in the military, are currently on or considering income based repayment options or are concerned about a steady source of future income and would want to lower their payments at some time in the future. When the borrower refinances, they waive any current and potential future benefits of their federal loans and replace those with the benefits of the Education Refinance Loan. For more information about federal student loan benefits and federal loan consolidation, visit <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov">http://studentaid.ed.gov</a>. We also have several resources available to help the borrower make a decision at <a href="http://www.citizensone.com/EdRefinance">http://www.citizenOne.com/EdRefinance</a>, including <a href="https://www.citizensbank.com/money-tips/student-loans/should-i-refinance.aspx">Should I Refinance My Student Loans?</a> and our FAQs. <a href="https://www.citizensbank.com/money-tips/student-loans/should-i-refinance.aspx">Should I Refinance My Student Loans?</a> includes a comparison of federal and private student loan benefits that we encourage the borrower to review. </p><p><strong>Citizens One Education Refinance Loan Eligibility: </strong>Eligible applicants may not be currently enrolled, must be in repayment of their existing student loan(s) and must make the minimum number of payments after leaving school. Primary borrowers must be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident or resident alien with a valid U.S. Social Security Number residing in the United States. Resident aliens must apply with a co-signer who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. The co-signer (if applicable) must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident with a valid U.S. Social Security Number residing in the United States. For applicants who have not attained the age of majority in their state of residence, a co-signer will be required. Citizens One reserves the right to modify eligibility criteria at anytime. Interest rate ranges subject to change. Education Refinance Loans are subject to credit qualification, completion of a loan application/consumer credit agreement, verification of application information, certification of borrower's student loan amount(s) and highest degree earned.</p></div>
